# Web Engineering II - Community Page

This is my first project with MongoDB and Nodejs Express. I worked on this project in the Semester 21/22.

This is supposed to be the backend for a Community Page that uses React -> https://github.com/georgno/we2-app

This repo is just to have public proof of what I worked on. 


# Setup

- Generate a `key.pem` and `cert.pem` file with **openssl** and store them in the `/certificates` folder
- change the `renameto.default.json`in the `/config` folder to `default.json` and insert your wished token and connectionString to the MongoDB instance
- finally `npm start` to start the application
